Sean Thimons is a Physical Scientist at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, focusing on **chemical risk assessment** for oil and gas wastewater, industrial wastewater, and water reuse. His research aims to enhance wastewater characterization for reuse, **prioritize emerging wastewater compounds**, and develop rapid chemical risk evaluation methods using high-throughput data.

Thimons holds an M.S. in Water Resources, Science & Technology from Texas A&M University – San Antonio, where his thesis explored **advanced treatment methods** for hypersaline brines and oil/gas waste streams.

Thimons' projects include supporting the EPA's Strategic Research Action Plans (StRAP), focusing on **risk characterization for water reuse**, **data curation** for chemical safety, and **technical assistance** for drinking water projects. He has developed applications for lead service-line inventory validation and site prioritization for water quality analysis. His work with the New Mexico Produced Water Research Consortium involves developing **risk-based workflows** for assessing treated produced water for reuse.

His technical contributions extend to tools like the [CompTox Chemistry Dashboard](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/), [Cheminformatics Toolbox](https://www.epa.gov/comptox-tools/cheminformatics), and [ECOTOX](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/index.cfm) Knowledgebase, **enhancing analysis** capabilities for thousands of compounds.

He also volunteers as a **data scientist** for a volunteer-research group focused on reducing homelessness utilizing **machine learning** and artificial intelligence.
