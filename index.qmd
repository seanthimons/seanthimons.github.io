I'm a Physical Scientist at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, focusing on **chemical risk assessment** for oil and gas wastewater, industrial wastewater, and water reuse. My research aims to enhance wastewater characterization for reuse, **prioritize emerging wastewater compounds**, and develop rapid chemical risk evaluation methods using high-throughput data.

I hold an M.S. in Water Resources, Science & Technology from Texas A&M University – San Antonio, where my thesis explored **advanced treatment methods** for hypersaline brines and oil/gas waste streams.

My work includes supporting EPA's Strategic Research Action Plans, focusing on **risk characterization for water reuse**, **data curation** for chemical safety, and **technical assistance** for drinking water projects. I've developed applications for lead service-line inventory validation and site prioritization for water quality analysis. With the New Mexico Produced Water Research Consortium, I develop **risk-based workflows** for assessing treated produced water for reuse.

I also contribute to tools like the [CompTox Chemistry Dashboard](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/), [Cheminformatics Toolbox](https://www.epa.gov/comptox-tools/cheminformatics), and [ECOTOX](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/index.cfm) Knowledgebase, enhancing analysis capabilities for thousands of compounds.

Outside of work, I volunteer as a **data scientist** for a research group focused on reducing homelessness using **machine learning** and artificial intelligence.

## Work Experience

I'm currently a Physical Scientist in EPA's Office of Water, working on wastewater technology and analytics. Previously, I spent four years with the Office of Research and Development (first as an ORISE Fellow, then as a Physical Scientist), where I focused on risk characterization for water reuse and chemical safety data curation.
