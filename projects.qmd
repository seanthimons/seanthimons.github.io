## Research Focus

My EPA research spans risk characterization for water reuse, chemical safety data curation, and cross-disciplinary integration for chemical safety decision-making.

## Technical Support

-   Region 8 RARE project: *Evaluation of Produced Water Intended for Beneficial Reuse in Multiple Oil and Gas Basins*. Stakeholders include EPA’s Region 3 and 6, US Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory, and US EPA ORD-CCTE/CEMM

    -   Front-end R Shiny application development for site prioritization utilizing field and experimental data for acute, chronic, and cumulative toxicological evaluation.

-   New Mexico Produced Water Research Consortium’s Risk and Toxicology work group (workgroup lead), the Multi-State Coordination Counsel, and the Water-Portal and Data Management work group.

    -   Development of risk-based workflow to assess acute and chronic potential across human and ecological receptors and determine potential for fit-for-purpose usage of treated produced water.

-   *Potable Water Reuse in Protein Production and Processing*, Collaborative partnership of Tyson Foods, University of Nebraska, and the United States Department of Agriculture

-   *Evaluating the Microbial and Chemical Quality of Air Handler Unit Condensate*, US EPA project

-   *Integrated Performance Framework for Emerging Contaminants in Wastewater Treatment Plants*, US EPA project

-   Technical support for New Mexico State University’s *Non-Targeted Analysis and Whole Effluent Toxicity* testing efforts for produced water to assess acute and chronic effects of exposure.

-   Technical support for *SSWR.411.3* : BIL/IIJA Funded Technical Assistance Projects to Support the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund

    -   Front-end R Shiny application development utilizing EJScreen and machine-learning models for site prioritization

## Selected Awards and Professional Experience

-   New Mexico Produced Water Research Consortium
-   US EPA *Shooting Star Award*: “Region 8 is grateful for your work organizing and analyzing our produced water data”
